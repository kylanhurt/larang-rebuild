# larang-rebuild

* This project is a combination of Angular (on the front end) and Laravel (PHP Framework) on the back-end. The latter is specifically installed within the /api folder, making that the root endpoint for all AJAX calls from Angular.

* Please note that both npm install / update and composer install / update will have to occur within the root and /api directories (respectively)

* Also don't forget to add .env file to /api, and also run 'php artisan up'
